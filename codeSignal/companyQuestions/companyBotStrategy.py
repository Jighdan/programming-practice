"""
Each CodeSignal Company Bot is trained by engineers from that specific company. The way it works is that a representative group of engineers from each company is identified as trainers before the bot goes live, and they CodeFight against the bot during a training phase. The current training algorithm is definitely more complex, but let's assume it works this way:

For each trainer we collect two pieces of information per task [answerTime, correctness], where correctness is 1 if the answer was correct, -1 if the answer was wrong, and 0 if no answer was given. In this case, the bot's correct answer time for a given task would be the average of the answer times from the trainers who answered correctly. Given all of the training information for a specific task, calculate the bot's answer time.

	return sum(correct) / len(correct) if len(correct) > 0 else 0
